        <h1>Day 11 - Response/Request Messages</h1>
        <p>
        Today I put the response / request functions of the http server into classes.

        I was really happy with the results and I think it was a useful exercise to do.

        My next goal is to use the properties method in classes. 

        Also I learned today that is the server has a print line in it's implementation 
        it causes the whole system to hang.  It took my a long time to figure that out.
